# litegl.js


This library wraps WebGL to make it more user-friendly by creating classes for Buffer, Mesh, Texture, Shader and other common aspects of any WebGL applications.
It is a fork from [LightGL.js](https://github.com/evanw/lightgl.js/) by Evan Wallace, but matrices were replaced by glMatrix and all the fixed pipeline aspects removed for clarity, some other major changes have been made til a point is no longer a fork.
