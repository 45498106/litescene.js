# Prefabs

It is common when creating scenes to reuse the same objects in the same scene or between different scenes.

To avoid having to create the object again LiteScene allow to create prefabs.

A prefab is a description of a SceneNode (its properties, components and children).

By creating a Prefab you can store that node info as a resource and invoke it whenever you need it.

## Creating Prefabs

You can create prefabs by code or using the WebGLStudio editor.
